                        <div class="desc">
                            Dear Colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen,
                            <br />
                            Thank you for joining us in Bhurban, Murree to attend 21st Annual Cardiology update 2021.
                            It’s my pleasure to walk you through the conference, introduce you to the speakers and delegates that have come from all over the globe today to share their knowledge and experience. Today’s conference has more then 200 participants participating from all around the world.
                            Due to the current global COVID-19 pandemic, after careful consideration, the Organizing Committee has decided to conduct 21st Annual Cardiology update in a hybrid format, dated on 30th July to 1st August, 2021 in Pearl Continental, Bhurban.
                            <br />
                            The theme of this conference is the “Updates on use of antithrombotic/ anticoagulants in cardiovascular diseases”. We have experts from across the field who will be staying with us for the next three days, sharing their thoughts, knowledge and opinions with the rest of us.
                            Together the strong support of colleagues at home and abroad, the Cardiology Conference has become an internationally recognized academic platform for sharing achievements, exchanging experience and meeting friends.
                            At this year’s conference, we, as always, are inviting well-known experts and scholars, to bring together hospitals and medical institutions to maximize participation. The conference aims to open up emerging academic areas and to broadly communicate trends and discoveries which are at the forefront of our field.  It will bring multi-dimensional, concrete, and brand-new perspectives and concepts to colleagues in the cardiovascular field.
                            <br />
                            As part of our efforts to control the COVID-19 epidemic, the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease has became a critical part of the overall effort. As the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 patients having IHK and related comorbidities is many fold.
                            We have special gratitude for our foreign faculty who are participating either virtually or have come all the way to make this conference a success.
                            We wish that our next cardiology update will be without COVID-19 restrictions and we will enjoy together the scenery and beautiful valley.
                            Finally, on behalf of the organizing committee, I would like to invite all cardiovascular fellows to participate in this meeting. I would also express my sincere gratitude to all colleagues, domestic and foreign academic institutions, societies and enterprises for their strong support. I also wish to extend my respect to those colleagues who are still fighting at the front lines of the epidemic.
                            I would like to conclude my speech by encouraging the delegates to participate with an increasing number in all the activities and discussions through the digital platforms for the next three days. I wish everyone a successful, safe and fruitful conference.
                            <br />
                            Thank You
                            <br />
